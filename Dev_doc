                  Static var == Uppercase
                  Enum == Uppercase
                  Everything else lowercase
                  _ as space in var names

* Classes:
                  Everything we implement we do as a class

*Version:
                  First number is sprint/workshop number (counting after development workshop) and the other is our internal version.
                  For example after first development workshop and two internal updates -> 1.2
                  After third workshop -> 3.2 etc
